=== Explanation:
1) The constant water depth is d=0.23 m.
2) The slope inclination in this study is 1:10.
3) Two slope locations are available: "S1350" and "S0700":

     "S1350"
     wavemaker is located at x=0 m
     1:10 slope begins at x=13.5 m
     WG01 is located at x=1.31 m
     WG02 is located at x=7.01 m
     WG03 is located at x=13.5 m
     WG04 is located at x=14.75 m

     "S0700"
     wavemaker is located at x=0 m
     1:10 slope begins at x=7 m
     WG01 is located at x=1.31 m
     WG02 is located at x=4 m
     WG03 is located at x=7.01 m
     WG04 is located at x=8.26 m

4) The accoustic wave gauges are Banner S18U. The sampling rate is 1000 Hz.
Lowpass filter with 10 Hz cutoff was performed. Obviously invalid entries are flagged as NaN.
The manufacturer-specified accuracy is 1 mm, so there's no need to dwell on sub-millimeter differences in the recordings.
5) In the .mat files, t=0 is defined as the instant the wave crest passes WG03.

=== Caution:
1) For solitary waves, this study only examines data from WG02 and WG03. 
Data from WG01 and WG04 are provided only for reference. 
Their quality has not been checked or guaranteed.

2) For LDNs, this study only examines data from WG03.
Data from WG01, WG02, and WG04 are provided only for reference.
Their quality has not been checked or guaranteed.

3) When the waves are too steep or break, the WG measurements become spiky and the data become unusable. 
This occurred often at WG04 and for larger-amplitude waves.
If you are interested in performing further processing in these circumstances to improve data quality, 
please contact the lead author Peter Lo for the unfiltered raw data.
